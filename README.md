## Overview
As part of the art and culture studio for Fall 2018 CS 147, our team decided to explore the domain of music creation via the 
lense of music producers to see if we could identify any existing needs. After walking through the five stages of the d.school's 
design thinking methodology (ie Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test) and constantly revisiting the insights generated from 
our original need-finding interviews, we noticed that music producers wanted to have a community where they can showcase their skills 
and collaborate with other like-minded artists along with consistent and easy scheduling to find time for said collaboraion. Upon 
exploring low-fi prototypes and concept videos, we decided to produce a gamified app that would allow music producers to fulfill 
their needs. 

## Gamification and Task Flow
When creating an account, users have the option to select one of two avatars--Jemi or Ronald. The fully developed version of Pife would have multiple avatars to select from.

The three defined tasks for Pife are: (1) practice, (2) perform, and (3) collaborate. In the practice task flow, users can set daily goals for how long they wish to practice. By meeting their daily practice goals, they are able to gain pife-points and increase their avatar's happiness. The perform task flow has two options--viewing other musician's performances or performing a live performance yourself. The collaborate task flow has the option of filtering users by the type of instrument they play and their genre of choice. Users are then taken to a Tinder-like flow where they can swipe right to ask to collaborate with another musician or swipe left otherwise. If a match has been made, a collaboration session will commence. Below are screenshots of each of the task flows. 



As for the gamified elements of Pife, we decided to create a reward shop where users felt their practice sessions could be rewarded with feature updates for their avatars. Along with this, we decided to incorporate an evolution of the avatar with the accumulation of streak points--how often do you regularly return back to the app. The reason why we decided to incorporate gamified elements into the app was to primarly incentivize users to continuously use the app and to make it simple and fun for musicians to form communities.
