PIFE - Always Have a Friend to Practice With
______________________________________
As part of the art and culture studio for Fall 2018 CS 147, our team decided to explore the domain of music creation via the 
lense of music producers to see if we could identify any existing needs. After walking through the five stages of the d.school's 
design thinking methodology (ie Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test) and constantly revisiting the insights generated from 
our original need-finding interviews, we noticed that music producers wanted to have a community where they can showcase their skills 
and collaborate with other like-minded artists along with consistent and easy scheduling to find time for said collaboraion. Upon 
exploring low-fi prototypes and concept videos, we decided to produce a gamified app that would allow music producers to fulfill 
their needs.
