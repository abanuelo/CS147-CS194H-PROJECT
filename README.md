## Overview
Our prototype was built using Android Studios and is available on our website as an .apk file. Simply download the .apk to access our prototype.

## Limitations
Since this is a prototype, some features and extended data sets that would exist in the final app are not present here. More specifically, our limitations include: 
<ul>
  <li>Jemi is fully implemented with animations, evolution and reward-receiving capabilities while Ronald is a static SVG (Jemi and Ronald are avatars that users can pick from)</li>
  <li>Limited number of avatars to choose from and limited reward items available in the shop (two different hats and two different shirts)</li>
  <li>Avatarâ€™s evolution is limited to baby stage evolving into the toddler stage</li>
  <li>Hard-coded for demo purposes: the practice tool times the user for 10 seconds (rather than 15 minutes) before congratulating the user on meeting their goal</li>
  <li>Practice tool does not capture audio to check if user is generating sound (practicing)</li>
  <li>Watching performances in the perform tool leads to empty performance rooms if no one is occupying the room</li>
  <li>Trophies the user has gained are hard-coded</li>
  <li>Collaboration schedules are hard-coded</li>
</ul>
